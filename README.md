# Demand-Prediction-of-Ola-Bikes
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for ride-hailing services like Ola Bike to optimize resource allocation, improve customer experience, and enhance profitability. This aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting Ola bike ride demand. This utilizes historical ride data, real-time weather information, and geographical factors to predict demand with high accuracy. It's performance is evaluated using various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing demand patterns and making reliable predictions. This employs regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, outlier handling, and rigorous model evaluations using mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics.The implementation of this model can significantly benefit Ola Bike in making informed decisions regarding vehicle deployment, driver management, and pricing strategies.
